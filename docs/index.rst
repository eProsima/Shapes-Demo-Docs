eProsima Shape Demo Analytics
=============================

The Shapes Demo is an application that Publishes and Subscribes to shapes of different colors and sizes moving on a board. Each Shape conforms its own topic: Square, Triangle or Circle. A single instance of the Shapes Demo can publish on or subscribe to several topics at a time.

It can be used to demonstrate the capabilities of eProsima Fast RTPS or as an interoperability demonstrator with other implementations of the RTPS protocol.
