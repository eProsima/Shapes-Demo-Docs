History and Durability
======================

*Fast DDS* allows Publishers to send data before Subscriber comes. All these publications are stored in the history of 
each Publisher, therefore, when a subscriber arrives it has two options, to start from scratch or to request all 
previous publications.

The history configuration determines the number of data that will keep in the send queue. The History of the Publishers 
is set to KEEP_LAST in this example and we have two options to the “Durability” concept, VOLATILE and TRANSIENT_LOCAL. 
If you select VOLATILE, the previous data samples will not be sent, on the contrary, if you select TRANSIENT_LOCAL, the 
*n* previous data samples will be sent to the late-joining subscriber.

In this test we have to launch three Publisher and three Subscriber in TRANSIENT_LOCAL mode.

Finally, you will see 100 red squares on Instance2 and Instance3, mirroring the movements of the red square in the 
publisher of Instance1. The leading square indicates the current position of the published square.

**Step-by-Step**

First, we have to launch three instances and create a Publisher in each of them:

1 - Create a red square publisher:
   - Start eProsima Shapes-Demo. (We will refer to this instance as Instance1)
   - Click on Publish.
   - Select SQUARE option for Shape and RED for Color.
   - Change the History field from 6 to 100.
   - Select TRANSIENT_LOCAL.
   
2 - Create an orange square publisher:
   - Start eProsima Shapes-Demo. (We will refer to this instance as Instance2)
   - Click on Publish.
   - Select SQUARE option for Shape and ORANGE for Color.
   - Change the History field from 6 to 100.
   - Select TRANSIENT_LOCAL.
   
3 - Create a black square publisher:
   - Start eProsima Shapes-Demo. (We will refer to this instance as Instance3)
   - Click on Publish.
   - Select SQUARE option for Shape and BLACK for Color.  
   - Change the History field from 6 to 100.
   - Select TRANSIENT_LOCAL.
   
Your windows should look similar to the following image.

5 - Click Subscribe on Instance2.
   - Select SQUARE option for Shape.
   - Change the History field from 6 to 100.
   
6 - Click Subscribe on Instance3.
   - Select SQUARE option for Shape.
   - Change the History field from 6 to 100.
