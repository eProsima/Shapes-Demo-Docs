eProsima Shapes Demo is an application in which Publishers and Subscribers are shapes of different colors and sizes
moving on a board.
Each shape refers to its own topic: Square, Triangle or Circle.
A single instance of the eProsima Shapes Demo can publish on or subscribe to several topics at a time.

It demonstrates the capabilities of eProsima *Fast DDS* or as a proof of interoperability with other
RTPS-compliant implementations.
