Content Based Filter
********************

In Fast RTPS, you can restrict the data that will be available to the
subscriber to control network and CPU usage. When you deploy a new
Subscriber, you can check the Content Based Filter. This filter draws
a shaded region in the shapes window. Only the samples that are inside
will be made available to the subscriber. You can resize and move this
region dynamically.

In this test, we are going to create two Publishers and two
Subscriber, one with Content Based.

**Step-by-Step**

First, you have to launch two instances and create a Publisher in each
of them:

1 - Create a red square publisher:
   * Start eProsima Shapes-Demo. (We will refer to this instance as
     Instance1)

   * Click on Publish.

   * Select SQUARE option for Shape and RED for Color.

   * Change the History field from 6 to 1.

2 - Create an orange circle publisher:
   * Start eProsima Shapes-Demo. (We will refer to this instance as
     Instance2)

   * Click on Publish.

   * Select CIRCLE option for Shape and ORANGE for Color.

   * Change the History field from 6 to 1.

Your windows should look similar to the following image.

Now, create two subscriber:

3 - Create a circle subscriber:
   * Start eProsima Shapes-Demo. (We will refer to this instance as
     Instance3)

   * Click on Subscribe.

   * Select CIRCLE option for Shape.

   * Change the History field from 6 to 1.

   * Check Content Based.

4 - Create a square subscriber:
   * Click on Subscribe in Instance3.

   * Select SQUARE option for Shape.

   * Change the History field from 6 to 1.

You will see a shaded rectangle in Instance3. This is the filter for
the samples of the Circle Shape.

If the circle is out of the rectangle, it is not available for the
subscriber.

On the contrary, if the instance is in the rectangle, it is available.

The rectangle is configurable, you can resize and move it dynamically.
The following images show examples of the filter.
