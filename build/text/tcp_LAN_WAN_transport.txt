TCP Transport
*************

Fast RTPS transport layer could be adapted to specific network
requirements. UDP transport is optimal for local network applications
but in order to interact on a Wide Area Network (WAN), where one or
several NAT mappings may be enforced, a TCP transport would be more
suitable. Here we explain how Shapes Demo should be set up in order to
fit some network specific layouts.


LAN configuration
=================

TCP over LAN can be tested in a scenario where several computers share
the same LAN network; nevertheless, UDP performs better and is the
advisable choice in practical situations. In this case one of the
computers should set up Shapes Demo as a server and all the others as
clients. Let’s suppose that the server computer LAN IP address is
192.168.2.49 then all clients instances of Shapes Demo in the other
computers must specify this IP Server address. In this case we select
as TCP port 5100 but any other available TCP port is valid. The server
computer firewall must allow inbound traffic on the selected port.

WAN configuration
=================

This is the typical TCP scenario where the server computer does not
share network with its clients but its reachable through a WAN IP
address. This may happen if the server and clients are in a different
LANs of the same WAN like WWW. In order to test this scenario we used
the following network layout:

[image: WAN test layout][image]

In the above diagram we can see:

   * a client LAN network managed by router C. In this network a
     client Shapes Demo instance runs in computer address
     192.168.2.17.

   * a server LAN network managed by router S. In this network the
     server Shapes Demo instance runs in computer address
     192.168.3.49. Router S NAT settings relay any inbound traffic to
     TCP port 5100 towards Sever computer. TCP port 5100 was
     arbitrarily chosen, any available port will do. The Server
     computer firewall settings allow inbound traffic to TCP port
     5100.

   * a Main router which simulates the WAN network. In this network
     router C has address 192.168.1.74 and router S has address
     192.168.1.75.

The previous configuration (see LAN configuration) does not work in
this network scenario because server and client are behind a NAT.

The above image shows server and client settings:

   * The client *server IP* is no longer the server IP address
     (192.168.3.49) because is meaningless in client context. The
     server’s router IP address must be used (router S 192.168.1.75)
     because the client’s router can understand this address and
     properly lead the outbound traffic.

   * The server *WAN IP* is the server’s router IP address (router S
     192.168.1.75). Router S NAT settings relay inbound traffic to
     server’s TCP port towards Server computer.
