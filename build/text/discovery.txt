Discovery and basic connectivity
********************************

In Fast RTPS, the discovery task is automatic. Fast RTPS performs the
task of finding the relevant information and distributing it to its
destination. It means that new nodes are automatically discovered by
any other in the network.

In this test we have to launch three Publishers and three Subscribers.
At the end, you will see two additional squares in each instance,
mirroring the movements of the original square in real-time.

**Step-by-Step**

First, you have to create three publishers:

1 - Create a red square publisher:
   * Start eProsima Shapes-Demo. (We will refer to this instance as
     Instance1)

   * Click on Publish.

   * Select SQUARE option for Shape and RED for Color.

2 - Create a blue square publisher:
   * Start eProsima Shapes-Demo. (We will refer to this instance as
